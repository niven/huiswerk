Web UI for simple math practice

Single page app, with 3 'modes':
1. Simple UI for picking multiplication tables to practice, or division with optional remainders
2. Somewhat gamified practice mode (the student is done when the HP of the program reaches 0)
3. Stats, shown at the end that gives some insight into the quality of the practice

The student gets practice sums, and incorrect answers lead to that sum being repeated.

# Fractions

1. Pick from 1 of 2 images of pie charts the one that represents the largest fraction.

## TODOs

- Picking from 1 of N pies
- Picking the smallest or the largest
- Some option for picking the 1 out of 3 that is not the same ( say 1/2, 3/6 and 3/5 or something)
- Adding fractions
- Simplifying fractions


# Problems

Intl.DateTimeFormat not supported in Safari which makes the timer display not work.

Counting the number of correct answers in a row fails the first time in Safari.

# Improvements

* More types of sums (splitting more complex multiplications)
* Choosing between timed practice and points targets.
